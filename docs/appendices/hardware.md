# Appendix C: Hardware

# Buying hardware from us

Getting all of the hardware on your own can be tricky because the parts you select may not fit perfectly. [That's why we sell kits with everything you need to build a Ploopy Trackpad](https://ploopy.co/product-category/trackpad/). Here's why that's great for you:

- Everything is guaranteed to fit together perfectly
- Everything is guaranteed to work as intended
- You'll end up saving money - probably quite a bit of money - by not spending on extra parts

Your call. You'll sort it out.

# Getting your own hardware

This guide was a bit light on detail in the other sections, and that's because the hardware has to conform to many specifications. They'll all be listed here.

First, a complete list of all the hardware you'll need:

- 4x Small Screws
- 4x Friction Pads
- 1x Tape

We'll be going over all of them in detail. There will be mentions of *critical specifications*; if you're going to be sourcing your own parts, **you must get parts that conform to the critical specifications**. If you go off-menu, the parts will not fit the way that we intended when we designed the trackball. That might mean that your trackball **doesn't work**.

Let's get cracking.

## Small Screws

Here are the critical specifications:

- \#2
- 3/8" length

## Friction pads

Here are the critical specifications:

- Circular shape
- Up to 3/4" diameter
- Up to 1/8" thickness
- Non-slip

## Tape

We use **3M 467MP** adhesive transfer tape in dimensions of 6" x 4". If you do not use this specific tape, you may find that the tracking is extremely erratic, or may not function at all. If you decide to use other tapes, you will be responsible for retuning the Trackpad.
